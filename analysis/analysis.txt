Question 1: are the benchmark timings for StringStrand consistent with the explanation below that 
the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(b2S)? 

Yes, since the runtime is dependent on s and b, in this case b is constant so it  is only dependent on s. In this case, it is linear so as s increases T increases 





Question 2: are the benchmark timings for StringBuilderStrand consistent with the explanation below that 
the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(bS)? 


Yes. This is the same as number 1. In this case, although it is 0(bs), b does not matter at all since it is constant. It is solely dependent on s. As s increases, t increases here too 
s




Question 3: Explain why the time for LinkStrand does not change much at all over all the runs in the benchmark program. 
Explain why you think memory is exhausted at the specific strand size you see in your timings -- as compared to exhaustion for String and StringBuilder.


Here, the size in cutAndSplice does not matter because it is all constant time
